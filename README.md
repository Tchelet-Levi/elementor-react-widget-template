# React + Elementor

This repo is a template for creating Elementor plugins with React.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
  npm i
  cd react-project
```

You can change the `react-project` folder to whatever you prefer later.

Make sure to change variable names in both elementor-react-template.php to avoid conflicts, as well as plugin.php (error messages, etc);

# TODO

- Add better support for slow loading apps. Make the widget take up the space it will need through elementor maybe to avoid layout shifts?
