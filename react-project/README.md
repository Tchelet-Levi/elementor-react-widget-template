# React + Elementor

This repo is a template for creating Elementor plugins with React.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
  npm i
  cd react-project
```

You can change the `react-project` folder to whatever you prefer later.

## Bugs

- For some reason, Elementor miscalculates the wrapper size sometimes in the editor. Refreshing the page sometimes fixes this.
